# MSc thesis in plain-text

## These notes do not contain the final content!!!

This directory contains my thesis in plain text so obviously the images and illustrations are missing but the content and algorithms should be here.

Writing them here will make it faster for me to concentrate on content and not formatting issues which should be handled each night after writing the content.

The final form will be in either Microsoft Word or Google Doc since I do not have time to mess with Latex!
