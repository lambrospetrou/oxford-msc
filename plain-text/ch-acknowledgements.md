# Acknowledgements

First of all, I would like to express my greatest appreciation to my project supervisor, Prof. Dan Olteanu, for his guidance, advices and feedback he provided me with the last couple of months. I really enjoyed our discussions on the different aspects of the project which many times occured during midnight hours chatting online or during all-day meetings! He supported me the whole time and was always available when I need him.

Furthermore, I would like to thank my family and friends inside and outside of the university circles that were near me and helped me successfully finish this degree each one in his own way. I want to explicitly express my gratitude for my mother, since she was always there for me, supporting me to keep moving forward and aiming for the best!

In addition, a special thank you goes to University of Oxford that funded me this whole year with the HEFCE scholarship, which in case it did not happen I would not have been able to come and study at Oxford.

Finally, I would like to thank the famous Victoria's Secret for its amazing shows, _Victoria's Secret Fashion Shows_, that provided me countless hours of multimedia content which allowed me to think out-of-the box when things were getting ugly and I needed a different way of thinking!
